            <h6 style="line-height: 1.6;"> I found Muscle Up Fitness to be a revelation. People and Trainers here are super welcoming and allow you to find your space within what they offer, which is a very varied and flexible training mix, not heavily machine reliant, and using old-school techniques flavoured with a flexible new-school take on things. These people with an adjacent yoga training space if you require it really opened up some diverse possibilities for fitness and well.being.
                I got nothing but good vibes from this space. Day in and day out. Great mix of people of all levels of fitness awareness, and a real sense of inclusivity. Well done guys. </h6>
