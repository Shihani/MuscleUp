            <h6 style="line-height: 1.6;"> I’ve been going to the gym for a number of years whenever I’m in town, and suffice to say ALL of the trainers have been great. Trainers here live what they preach, and are a great example of how to maximise your best assets and look after yourself. I attend according to the schedule they given pretty regularly and I can say that they are solid, fun and varied. Absolutely no two are the same so you get a great full body workout, and if lifting is your thing, that is also incorporated into the routines. Trainers pushes everyone ( regardless of fitness levels,) to their own individual optimum, so even though you’re in a class it also feels like you have your own personal trainer. Really can’t say enough good things about the trainers and I’m super happy with results. THANK YOU MUSCLE UP!</h6>
